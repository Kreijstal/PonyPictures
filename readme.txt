Hello, so you're here, as you can see this zip doesn't have that many images, isn't that right.
Well, because this doesn't have ANY images, it merely has references to those images.
These images are unnamed, I've been thinking in a way to give them names, Though. It's really hard actually.

I'd like an online directory where I could update pictures and stuff, anyway, here I go.

This is actually a scrap, this is the first version, in next ones, we will probably use other hosts -_-, give some names, remove some duplicates, etc.
This is not an easy job, you can help organize this mess too! You should! 
And we can make our pony pic directory together.

Anyway, if you're wondering how to do this, well..

first of all, you should get wget on your %path% enviromental variable, to do this, you kinda have to go to system properties, advanced settings, enviromental variables, append a ; add this pathname to there and done.

Otherwise you could simply put wget executable on some directory that is part of %path%, you can move wget.exe to C:/ or something if you're feeling lazy.
If you already have wget, then nevermind.
For windows users just click on the .bat file, if you have wget on your path, you should start downloading them pony pictures.

Linux users, except gentoo, should already have wget, but they prob can't execute batch files, oh well, I assume is not that hard to convert bat to bash, it's really just calling wget with arguments.

..*sigh*
if you don't want to move wget to C:\ because you're afraid or some shit.. 
I made the addtopath.bat and files for you, execute them in the same directory as wget.exe is.
Run as admin, etc, etc.

Hmm, there shouldn't there be need to be an admin to do this, I agree, in the next version I'll make it possible to do this (without being annoying) without being an admin.

ALTERNATIVELY:If you're not an admin, you can do this: move wget.exe to the .bat file directory you're going to execute.. then execute the batch file, it might be a little annoying, but it works.
